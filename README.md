## Jamal webpage

- source code in github https://github.com/viktor255/jamal
- was hosted on Axfone https://www.axfone.cz - but be aware it was bought by another company, so now we do not have access to admin interface, but FTP still works

### How to push changes to real webpage
1. make changes and push to github repo
2. push changes to FTP server `jamalsk.sk` - name/password can be found in password manager
